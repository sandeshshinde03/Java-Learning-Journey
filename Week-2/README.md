# 🗓️ Week 2: Data Types, Variables & Operators

This week, I focused on strengthening my Java fundamentals by exploring data types, variables, operators, and expressions.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Primitive & Non-Primitive Data Types
- Type Casting & Type Promotion
- Operators: Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Conditional, Bitwise, Precedence
- Expressions and Operator Precedence

## 💻 Practice Programs

1. **MiniCalculator.java** – Simple calculator using arithmetic operators
2. **AreaVolume.java** – Calculates area of a rectangle and volume of a cuboid
3. **TypeCasting.java** – Demonstrates implicit & explicit type casting and type promotion
4. **SimpleInterest.java** – Calculates simple interest using arithmetic operators
5. **TemperatureConverter.java** – Converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit

## 🧩 Extra Skill

- Wrote a small `README.md` to introduce my Week 2 practice programs on GitHub

## ⭐ Next week

I’ll explore Control Statements and Loops in Java
